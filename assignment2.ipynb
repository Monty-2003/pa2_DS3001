In my cleaning of this variable, I decided to only edit the obviously misentered/overlapping values. I changed the one \"boatomg\" value to \"boating\", as it was obviously a typo. I also changed all \"Boat\" values to \"Boating\", as these represent the same string value and should be the same. I combined the unverified column with the unconfirmed column, for these differences are too marginal to have separate values, unless documentation was provided to suggest why they are different.
